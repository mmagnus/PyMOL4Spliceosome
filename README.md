PyMOL session of 6 cryo-em structures: 

- S2_Bact_5gm6
- S3_C_5lj3
- S4_Cstar_5mps
- S5_P_6exn
- S5_P_5ylz
- S6_ILS_5y88 

The structures superimposed based on the U6 RNA.

Colors and chain mapping based on pyMoL_colors-EMX.xlsx prepared by Eysmont and Magnus.

Not everything is perfect, expect some updates soon.
