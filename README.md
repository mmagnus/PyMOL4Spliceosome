PyMOL session of 6 cryo-em structures: 

- B act complex 5gm6
- C complex 5lj3
- C star 5mps
- P complex (two structures)
    - 6exn
    - 5ylz
- ILS 5y88 

The structures superimposed based on the U6 RNA.

Colors and chain mapping based on pyMoL_colors-EMX.xlsx prepared by Eysmont and Magnus.

Not everything is perfect, expect some updates soon.
