**Tip: the session now is very big and it might slow your computer. We recommend to open it one, remove unnecessary things for your analysis and save it as a new session.**

Processed PyMOL session of cryo-em structures, see https://github.com/mmagnus/PyMOL4Spliceosome/releases to learn more about current stage of the project.

The structures superimposed based on the U6 RNA (if possible)

Colors and chain mapping based on pyMoL_colors-EMX.xlsx prepared by Eysmont and Magnus.

Not everything is perfect, expect some updates soon.

## Tips

    With Up Down with Righ-mouse Click

## Quick reference

	PyMOL>enable CWC15*
	PyMOL>disable CWC15*

    # select only some objects and save it to the file
    save /Users/magnus/Desktop/XXXX_triplex_zoom.pse, CXXX_P and U2_P and U6_P
